`dendrotox` is a Python module designed to enable Python code to interact with the [Tox](https://tox.chat/) distributed communications network, including for the purposes of scripts communicating with people or other scripts. It uses a 2015 version of [ToxCore](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/releases/tag/api_old_version) and [ratox](https://github.com/kytvi2p/ratox) for interfacing with the Tox network and [megaparsex](https://github.com/wdbm/megaparsex) for parsing.

In particular, `dendrotox` interacts with the filesystem provided by the FIFO Tox client [ratox](https://github.com/kytvi2p/ratox). `dendrotox` also provides functionality to send and receive messages, to parse input, to send files, to request confirmations, to provide information such as IP address and weather information, and to run arbitrary commands, including functionality to launch reverse-SSH connections and to restart a script.

# Tox

Tox is a peer-to-peer instant-messaging and video-calling protocol that has end-to-end encryption.

The following is a typical Tox ID that one contact can give to another contact in order to connect:

<--------------------------------------------------------------><------><-->
                                ^                                  ^      ^
                                |                                  |      |
                                |                                  |      |
                            PUBLIC KEY                        NOSPAM      CHECKSUM
```

The Tox ID is a public key (64 characters), a nospam value (8 characters) and a checksum (4 characters) concatenated in hexadecimal format. The result is a 76 character string.

The public key is generated by the NaCl (Networking and Cryptographic library) `crypto_box_keypair` function. It is 32 bytes (64 hexadecimal characters). The nospam value is a generated pseudorandom number appended to the public key. A connect request sent without the correct nospam value is ignored. The nospam value can be changed at any time without affecting the public key, stopping all requests to the current ID, in order to fight spam. The checksum is a simple XOR checksum of the public key and the nospam value. It is used to quickly verify the integrity of the Tox ID.

Because Tox has no central servers, it is necessary to know a node that is already in the network before a client can be connected suffessfully. Some nodes are listed [here](https://nodes.tox.chat/json).

# setup

```Bash
sudo apt install    \
    autoconf        \
    autotools-dev   \
    automake        \
    build-essential \
    checkinstall    \
    check           \
    cmake           \
    festival        \
    git             \
    libtool         \
    libsodium-dev   \
    yasm
```

```Bash
mkdir ~/Tox
cd ~/Tox
```

Install FFmpeg.


```Bash
sudo apt install lame libmp3lame-dev
wget http://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-3.3.2.tar.bz2
tar -xvf ffmpeg-3.3.2.tar.bz2
cd ffmpeg-3.3.2
./configure --enable-libmp3lame
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
cd ..
rm ffmpeg-3.3.2.tar.bz2
rm -rf ffmpeg-3.3.2
```

Install the Sodium crypto library.

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium.git
cd libsodium
git checkout tags/1.0.3
./autogen.sh
./configure
make check
sudo checkinstall --install --pkgname libsodium --pkgversion 1.0.0 --nodoc
sudo ldconfig
cd ..
```

Install the libvpx codec.

```Bash
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/webm/libvpx
cd libvpx
git checkout tags/v1.4.0
./configure --enable-shared --disable-static
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
cd ..
```

Install ToxCore.

```Bash
wget --content-disposition https://codeload.github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/tar.gz/api_old_version
tar -xvf toxcore-api_old_version.tar.gz
cd toxcore-api_old_version
autoreconf --install --force
mkdir _build
cd _build
../configure
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
cd ../..
```

Install `ratox`.

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/wdbm/ratox.git
cd ratox
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

Install dendrotox.

```Bash
sudo pip install dentrodox
```

When `ratox` is launched for the first time, it creates a Tox profile file `.ratox.tox` at the working directory to store Tox profile details. While running, the file `id` contains the Tox ID.

# examples

`dendrotox` is imported and launched in the following way:

```Python
import dendrotox
dendrotox.start_messaging()
print("Tox ID: " + dendrotox.self_ID())
```

A message can be sent to a contact in the following way, where a contact is specified using a string containing their Tox ID:

```Python
dendrotox.send_message(contact = contact, text = "oohai")
```

A message can be sent to multiple contacts in the following way, where contacts are specified as a list of strings containing contacts' Tox IDs.

```Python
dendrotox.send_message(contacts = [contact_1, contact_2], text = "sup")
```

A message can be sent to all contacts in the following way.

```Python
dendrotox.send_message(contacts = "all", text = "yo yo yo")
```

A list of unseen messages received recently can be accessed in the following ways:

```Python
messages = dendrotox.received_messages()
print(messages[0].sender())
```

```Python
message = dendrotox.last_received_message()
print(message)
```

A sound call can be sent to a contact in a few ways. One way is by sending a sound file:

```Python
dendrotox.send_call(contact = contact, filepath = "alert.wav")
```

Another way is by using a microphone:

```Python
dendrotox.send_call(contact = contact, record = True)
```

Another way is by using synthesized speech:

```Python
dendrotox.send_call_synthesized_speech(contact = contact, text = "This is an alert.")
```

See module code and example bot code for more advanced usage, including calls, message parsing, confirmations and running commands.

# dendrotox_alert.py

The script `dendrotox_alert.py` is a command line script that can be used to send a message to contacts. It attempts to connect with any specified contacts before attempting to send a message to them. If no contacts are specified, it attempts to send a message to all known contacts.

```Bash
dendrotox_alert.py --text="alert"
```
